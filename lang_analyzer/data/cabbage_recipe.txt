Flavorful, good-for-you, and simple to make, cabbage soup is one of our go-to’s when we’re looking for a warm and cozy weeknight dinner. While we love this basic recipe, it’s also completely customizable: Switch up the veggies and protein as you please based on what you have on hand. If you’re looking for a light and nutrient-packed soup to warm you up, then this is the recipe for you. Here’s everything you need to know to make this quick dinner the best it can be:

All about the cabbage:
We know how healthy beans are for us, but cabbage is also a powerhouse. It’s packed with vitamins C and K, contains loads of fiber, and is also an inflammatory wonder (especially red cabbage, which BTW will impart a beautiful hue to the finished soup).

How to make cabbage soup:
— Add in some protein. Leftover pulled pork, shredded chicken, or braised beef would be delicious protein boosts in this soup. Add it in during the last few minutes of cooking, just to warm it up.
— Use a variety of cabbage. ANY kind of cabbage variety works here, including green, red, savoy, napa, and bok choy. Go for any of these, or even mix them up!
—Make it vegan. If you’re looking for a fully vegan recipe, simply use vegetable broth instead of chicken.

Serving ideas:
There’s no shortage of great sides for this cabbage soup. Serve it alongside French bread, sweet potato salad, cabbage wrapped brats (for even more cabbage love), or even some garlic mashed potatoes to make this meal a comfort food dream.

Storing cabbage soup:
To store this soup, let it cool entirely before storing it in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days in the fridge. Alternatively, you can freeze it for up to 2 months.
