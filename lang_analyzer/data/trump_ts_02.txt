Sloppy Chris Christie did so poorly in the Great State of New Hampshire in 2016 that immediately after the votes were counted, he dropped out and endorsed me. He then went back to New Jersey, which he had effectively abandoned to campaign (much like DeSanctimonious in Florida!), to an approval rating of 9%. New Hampshire doesn’t like that Sloppy RINO Dog, and they don’t like Ron, who is in 5th place, either. MAGA!
